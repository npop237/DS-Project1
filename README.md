# DS-Project1
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 1 - Writing a Blog Post

Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

For this project, I wanted to use Airbnb data to explore accommodation in Nashville and in particular find out:

1) What time of year is the best to visit for cheaper accommodation
2) How big the properties are and how does this compare to other US cities
3) What makes for a good airbnb review and what should I look out for when I'm booking a place to stay

File Descriptions

There is one notebook available here to showcase my work related to the above questions. This notebook shows my exploration of the datasets, my analysis and any models I've created based on the data. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
